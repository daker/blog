There have been a lot of discussions about new designs(specially the new header and bottom edge), a lot of autopilot tests fixes and sure the Core Apps devs have provided a lot of feedback about their experience using the SDK components, QTC, Click tools(packaging) and writing autopilot tests.

## HTML5 SDK
In Tuesday, me Alex Abreu and David Barth had a meeting to discuss what needs to be done for the HTML5 SDK, then i started working on the implementation of the [new header][0] design, which will be done in steps.

### Tabs

We still need to add more new APIs to the header, but this will involve updating autopilote tests to make sure everything works as expected.

I have also started working on updating some componenets like the Slider and Switch/Toggle while i was coming back home

We still have a lot things in the pipe(i18n, grid system, sheets), stay tuned!

It was a wonderful and very productif week, thanks to everyone and specially Michelle & Popey!
I hope we will be invited again next time.
