Hello World! I’ve been wanting a to start my own blog for a while now. Time and other constraints have been preventing me, but I finally sat down over the last week-end and hacked together what you actually see.

It’s all handwritten in [markdown][0], generated by [mynt][1], and powered by [Github pages][2], with commenting by [Disqus][3].

I have decided to license the content of this website under a Creative Commons license; CC-BY-SA 3.0 Unported, to be exact. This means that you can take what I will write on this blog, reuse it for whatever you see fit, or combine it with other content under the same license, e.g. from Wikipedia. The only requirements are that :

* you quote where you got it from, i.e. from me (Adnane Belmadiaf) and this website ([daker.me][4])
* you share the result under the same license

So feel free to leave a comment or tweet me [@AdnaneBelmadiaf][5].
